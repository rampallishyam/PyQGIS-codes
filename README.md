# PyQGIS-codes
Here you can find the codes of unsupervised learning techniques used on GPS data. You can use this codes to run in QGIS and execute the Algorithms. This work has been done towards the completion of my master thesis and was quite useful for testing the algorithms.

Algorithms included:
1. K-means
2. DSBCAN
3. Mean-shift
4. Hybrid combination of K-means and DSBCAN
